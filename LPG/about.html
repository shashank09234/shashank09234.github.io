            <article>
                <p>The year was 1896. Eight Dutch coal wholesalers had brought their heads together to take a historic decision. There was a new threat emerging in the German town of Essen in the form Rhenish Westphalian Coal Syndicate. The eight had to figure out something to battle the growing hegemony of the German arm in the Rhine Coal Delta. That was how Steenkolen Handels-Veerening or SHV was born. The journey from a small coal trading organization to the one of the largest LPG Distributor in the world with presence in 28 countries across 4 continents, serving a staggering 30 million customer base is an entrepreneurial journey in itself.
                <br>Touching Milestones:
                1896: SHV Holdings flagged off its journey.<br>
                1904: Emerged as the forefront player in the Dutch Coal Market<br>
                1939: First oil bunker station to its name.<br>
                1950: SHV made the switch from solid to liquid fuels.
                1963: Ventured into developing natural gas with its peripheral Dyas.<br>
                    1995: SUPERGAS came into existence in the Indian oil and gas market.</p>
